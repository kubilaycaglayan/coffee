## Built With

## ‚≠ê Getting Started ‚≠ê

### Prerequisites
- A modern browser, up to date.
- Node.js, if you are going to use it in the local environment.
- A text editor.

### Setup
##### First clone the repository(in Terminal):
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kubilaycaglayan/coffee.git`
- Enter the project directory: `cd coffee`
- Checkout to current the working branch `git checkout coffee`
- Run npm to install the dependencies `npm install`
- Run bundle to install the dependencies `bundle`
- Initialize the database with these set of commands `rails db:create && rails db:migrate && rails db:seed`

### <h3 id='usage-local'>üñ•Ô∏è Running In The Local Environment</h3>

After setup:
- Start the server `rails s`
- You can visit the website by typing this to your browser: `http://localhost:3000/`

### <h3 id='tests'>üß™ Automated Tests</h3>

> There are two sets of tests for this project. One for Rails and one for React side.

After setup:

##### React Test (36)
- Run tests with `npm run test`
- All the API methods, reducers and actions are tested. Also, containers and components which does not require login are also tested.

##### Rails Test (51)
- Run tests with `rspec`
- All controller actions are tested with requests. Also model associations tested.

### <h3 id='extras'>Which "Nice To Have Requirements" I Have Added To My Project?</h3>
##### NTHR-1
- Implement proper user authentication from the front-end to the server
##### WHY
> I wanted to learn more about authentication relationships between rails and react, when we are not allowed to use rails views.

##### NTHR-2
- Create a user table in your database, so that a given user could only access the favourites they selected
##### WHY
> I wanted to give my users a better experience. They can have their own isolated area in the website. They customize their favorites list. Also easily scalable to other features like sending text messages.

##### NTHR-3
- Create an admin panel to <strong>create</strong> /<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">update</span> / <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">delete</span> houses
##### WHY
> I wanted to give my users a better experience. They can have create own coffees. This is not as an admin panel. Every logged in user can add a coffee to the system with an image.

### <h3 id='futurefeatures'>Future Features</h3>

- Users can delete the coffees.
- Users update coffees.
- Users can send text messages each other.
